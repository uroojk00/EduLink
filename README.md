# EduLink
EduLink is a full-stack, cross-platform application designed to revolutionize the way students access and share educational materials. It addresses the challenge of costly textbooks and fragmented information by creating a single, centralized hub where users can exchange notes, buy/sell used resources, engage in subject-specific discussions, and stay updated on educational news.

This project was developed using a MERN stack backend and a native Android application, providing a scalable, secure, and intuitive learning environment.
